      <h3 class = "alltext">How to combat body dysmorphia ?</h3>
      <p class = "alltext">You can combat body dysmorphia with a combination of therapeutic interventions, healthy habits, 
         and support systems.Recovery from BBD is a gradual process.</p>
      <ol class = "alltext">Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is usually recommended for treating body dysmorphia. CBT 
          helps people recognize and change bad thoughts and actions they have about their bodies. This 
          therapy also teaches ways to deal with upsetting feelings and thoughts. </ol>
      <ol class = "alltext">Building a supportive network of friends, family members, or support groups can provide 
          encouragement, validation, and understanding. Sharing your  experiences with others who have 
          similar struggles can reduce feelings of isolation and shame.
      </ol>
      <ol class = "alltext">Participating in activities that promote overall well-being, such as regular exercise, 
          nutritious eating, and sufficient sleep, can help improve mood and self-esteem. But, it's 
          important to maintain balance and avoid extremes that may exacerbate body image concerns.
